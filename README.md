# GitTutorial #

This package contains the Git Tutorial for the Robotics Club.
By the end of this tutorial, this repository should have a list of everyone that attended the Robotics Club Git Lecture, and attendees should hopefully have an understanding of basic concepts such as add, commit, checkout, merge, push/pull, and merge conflict resolution.
